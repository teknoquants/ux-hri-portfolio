 # Roger Cooperman — UX & Human-Robot Interaction Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!  
I design **intuitive, real-time interfaces for robots** that make human-robot collaboration effective, safe, and approachable.  
This site is hosted with GitHub Pages and showcases selected case studies in **UX design, HRI, and real-time robotics visualization**.

## 🔹 About
I’m a UX & HRI Designer with 5+ years of combined experience in **UX design, robotics, and real-time systems**.  
My focus:  
- Designing **2D & 3D interfaces** for telepresence and robot fleet monitoring.  
- Building and maintaining **design systems** across simulation and control dashboards.  
- Conducting **user studies and feedback loops** to refine interactions iteratively.  
- Bridging **Figma prototypes → ROS 2 / Gazebo simulations** → deployable UIs.

## 🔹 Selected Work
### 1. Telepresence Control Dashboard
- **Challenge**: Operators struggled with remote navigation context switching.  
- **Approach**: Task analysis → Figma wireframes → ROS 2 + RViz prototype → iterative testing.  
- **Outcome**: Streamlined controls and clearer state cues improved operator efficiency.  

### 2. Robot Fleet Visualization
- **Challenge**: Limited situational awareness across multiple robots.  
- **Approach**: Operator interviews → density-aware layouts → simulation prototyping.  
- **Outcome**: Unified dashboards with alerts/maps improved monitoring confidence.  

### 3. Quantum Sensor Visualization
- **Challenge**: Make |ψ|² data understandable for non-technical users.  
- **Approach**: Visual grammar for probability fields → 3D widgets in simulation.  
- **Outcome**: Abstract data transformed into actionable insights for operators.  

### 4. Simulation-based HRI Prototypes
- **Challenge**: Validate interfaces before costly field trials.  
- **Approach**: Rapid prototyping in Gazebo/ROS 2 with user feedback loops.  
- **Outcome**: Faster iteration cycles and reduced deployment risks.

## 🔹 Tech & Tools
- **Design & Prototyping**: Figma, RViz, Qt, Unity  
- **Robotics Simulation**: Ignition Gazebo, ros_gz_bridge  
- **Frameworks**: ROS 2, PyTorch (for perception), TensorRT (for optimization)  
- **Methods**: UX research, iterative prototyping, design systems, HRI evaluation
